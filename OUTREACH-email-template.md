**Subject:** Free AI Literacy Program for Your School

Hi [Principal Name],

I'm reaching out because I believe students deserve early exposure to AI — before they're in college or at their first job struggling to understand a tool the whole workplace is using.

**The Pitch:**

Aplosol is an AI education platform for K-12. We offer:

- **Curriculum-aligned modules** for K-2, 3-5, and 6-8 grades
- **Teacher-friendly lessons** (no coding required)
- **Free pilot program** for schools (Feb-March 2026)
- **Student outcomes:** Understand what AI is, how it works, real-world applications

We're looking for 3-5 schools in the Moncton area to pilot this program. Pilot schools receive:

✓ Free course access for all students
✓ Teacher training & support materials
✓ Weekly progress reports
✓ Early-bird pricing if you decide to enroll (30% off annual memberships)

**Why now?**

Parents and administrators are asking: "When will my child learn about AI?" We're here to answer that question.

**Next Step:**

Would you be available for a 15-minute call next week to see if Aplosol is a fit for [School Name]? I can show you the curriculum, student testimonials, and answer any questions.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best,

### Version B: Teacher / Curriculum Lead

**Subject:** AI Education Resource for Your Classroom (Free Pilot)

Hi [Teacher Name],

I came across [School Name] while researching schools committed to modern education, and I thought you'd find this useful.

**What is Aplosol?**

Aplosol is a free (for now!) AI literacy program for K-12 students. Think of it as "financial literacy meets AI" — we're teaching students *how to think about AI*, not how to code.

**What You Get:**

- Pre-built lesson plans (30-45 min per lesson, no prep required)
- Interactive student modules
- Discussion prompts & activities
- Teacher dashboard (track student progress)
- Certificate of completion

**Why Teachers Love It:**

Most teachers haven't trained on AI. We handle the content. You handle the classroom. It takes 2 hours to onboard.

**Free Pilot (Feb-March):**

We're offering free access to 3-5 classrooms in Moncton to test this out. If your school is interested, reply here and I'll get you set up within 24 hours.

**One Question:**

Would this work better as a once-per-week lesson or a 2-week intensive unit in your class?

Let me know!

Best,  
Krish  
Aplosol Founder
