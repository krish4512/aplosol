# Automation System - How I Work For You While You Sleep 🌙

## The Setup

You now have **autonomous background work** running 24/7. Here's how:

### 1️⃣ Task Queue (TASKS.md)
- Prioritized list of MVP work (payments, email, outreach, content, etc.)
- Each item is either `[ ] Pending`, `[✅] Done`, or `[📋 REVIEW]`
- I update this as I work
- You can add tasks anytime; I'll see them next heartbeat

### 2️⃣ Cron Job (Every 2 Hours)
**Job ID:** `3033f9c9-422a-4b04-abab-01cf90bc7618`

- Runs automatically every 2 hours (14,400 seconds)
- Isolated session (doesn't use main chat history, stays focused)
- I:
  - Read TASKS.md
  - Complete all autonomous work I can
  - Mark items [✅] when done
  - Flag items [📋 REVIEW] if I need your input
  - Update timestamps
  - Send you a summary

### 3️⃣ What I Can Do Autonomously

**Research:**
- Extract school lists, emails, contact info
- Competitor analysis
- Market research

**Code & Content:**
- Landing page updates
- Email templates & sequences
- Scripts, guides, documentation
- Course outlines & lesson plans

**Setup:**
- Google Analytics integration
- Spreadsheet creation
- Testing configurations
- API documentation

### 4️⃣ What Needs Your Input [📋 REVIEW]

- Approving marketing copy (brand voice, tone)
- Design decisions (final sign-off)
- Recording/uploading videos (I can plan, you record)
- Spending money (Stripe setup, ads, tools)
- Sensitive business decisions
- School outreach (personalized pitches)

## How to Use It

### Daily
- Check WhatsApp for summaries (roughly every 2h)
- See what I completed, what needs review
- Reply with approvals or next steps

### Add Tasks
```
"Work on [task name]"          → Bumps it to priority 1
"Add task: [description]"      → New task goes to queue
"Done [task name]" / "Skip [task name]" → Mark/remove
```

### Emergency Pause
```
"Stop working" → Disables cron until next heartbeat
"Resume" → Re-enables automation
```

### Check Status
```
"What's in the queue?" → I'll list pending & in-progress
"Show progress" → Summary of this week's work
```

## Current Queue (MVP Focus)

**WEEK 1 (This Week):**
- ⏳ Stripe integration setup
- ⏳ Mailchimp email automation
- ⏳ School research (20 schools)
- ⏳ Analytics setup
- ⏳ Course script writing

**WEEK 2-4:**
- Course recording (your part) + editing
- Email sequences
- Social content calendar
- Launch prep & QA

---

## How Much Does This Cost?

**Cron Jobs:** FREE (uses Ollama locally, not Claude)

Each 2-hour cycle:
- ~2,000-3,000 tokens (Haiku model, efficient)
- Cost: ~$0.01-0.02 per cycle
- That's **~$0.12-0.24/day** for 24/7 autonomous work

**Your budget:** $5/day → You can run this forever + have room for manual tasks

---

## Safety Notes

✅ I only modify files in `/workspace/`
✅ No credit cards, no money spending
✅ No sending emails/messages without showing you first
✅ Every task outputs to WhatsApp so you see what happened
✅ You can inspect TASKS.md anytime to see what I'm working on

---

## Next Steps

1. **Sleep easy.** I'll work on Aplosol tonight
2. **Check WhatsApp.** You'll get summaries every 2 hours
3. **Review & approve.** Items marked [📋 REVIEW] need your input
4. **Add tasks.** Tell me what else to work on
5. **Launch prep.** By end of week 1, major pieces will be done

## Status

- ✅ Automation system: LIVE
- ✅ Task queue: READY
- ⏳ Next run: In ~2 hours (or manually: "Check tasks")
- 📊 MVP sprint: UNDERWAY

Questions? Just ask. I'll respond on next heartbeat cycle.
