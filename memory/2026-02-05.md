## What Needs Your Input [📋 REVIEW]

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **Video recording gear** — I can recommend based on budget (phone camera OK, or $200-500 setup)
2. **Stripe account setup** — Do you have one? Or should we create?
3. **Mailchimp account** — Free tier OK for launch, need confirmation
4. **Email review** — Read the 10 templates, approve tone/messaging
5. **School outreach timeline** — Should we send Week 1 (20 emails), or start smaller?

### Week 2 (Post-Recording)
6. **Video editing tool** — iMovie (Mac), CapCut (mobile), DaVinci Resolve (free pro)
7. **CDN choice** — Cloudinary vs Bunny vs AWS (hosting + streaming)
8. **Stripe + Mailchimp integration** — I'll set up once accounts exist

### Documentation
9. **Pitch deck design** — Need designer or use Canva template?
10. **Social media imagery** — Stock photos + branding graphics for posts
