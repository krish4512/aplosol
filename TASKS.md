## HOW TO USE THIS

**For me (Optimus):**
- Every 2 hours, I'll check this list
- I'll complete what I can autonomously (research, code, content writing, setup)
- For items needing your input, I'll mark them [📋 REVIEW] and notify you
- Completed items move to [✅] Done

**For you:**
- Review items marked [📋 REVIEW]
- Add new tasks anytime (I'll see them on next heartbeat)
- Say "skip [task name]" to remove tasks
- I'll work on everything else without asking
