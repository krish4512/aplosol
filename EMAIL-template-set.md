Hi [First Name],

Welcome! You just took the first step toward understanding AI.

## Template 2: Welcome Series - Email 2 (Day 3, Engagement)

**Subject:** How's Module 1 Going?

---

Hi [First Name],

I noticed you signed up for Aplosol a few days ago. Just wanted to check in:

**Have you started yet?** No judgment if not — life gets busy.

**Need help?** Sometimes the login can be tricky. If you're stuck, reply here and I'll fix it.

**Questions about the content?** Drop them in the comments on the lesson, or reply here.

The goal is simple: You should finish Module 1 and feel like you actually *get* what AI is. If you're not there yet, that's on me to explain it better.

**Next week**, if you've finished Module 1, I'll send you the link to Module 2 (Way cooler — you get to build your own AI).

Keep going. You've got this.

Krish

P.S. — If you're finding this super easy, jump ahead to Module 2. No need to wait.

## Template 3: Welcome Series - Email 3 (Day 7, Nurture)

**Subject:** Finished Module 1? → Here's Module 2

---

Hi [First Name],

If you finished Module 1: **Congrats!** You're already ahead of most people your age.

If you didn't finish yet: **That's cool.** Everyone learns at their own pace. Just reply if you need help.

**Module 2 is live:** "How Computers Think"

This one is my favorite. You'll learn the secret language computers use to make decisions. It's simpler than you think.

**Access it here:** [module link]

*(Takes 11 minutes)*

**One question:** Are you learning solo, or is a teacher helping? Just curious — it helps me know if Aplosol is working for different types of learners.

Keep going.

## Template 4: Nurture Series - Interest-Based (Course Upgrade)

**Subject:** Want to Go Deeper with AI?

---

Hi [First Name],

You've made it through all 4 modules. That's awesome. Most people quit after Module 1.

**Here's what we're building next:**

1. **AI for Game Developers** (Intermediate level) — Build games that use AI opponents
2. **AI for Artists** (Advanced) — Use AI to generate images, music, and art
3. **AI Career Path** (High School) — What AI jobs look like + how to prepare

These are paid courses ($15-35 each), but since you finished the free intro, you get **40% off** with code: `EARLY_BIRD_40`

**The question:** Do any of these sound interesting?

Just reply and let me know. No pressure. The free modules will always be there.

Krish

P.S. — We're also launching a membership program ($29/mo) with monthly deep-dives into new AI topics. More info coming soon.

## Template 5: Re-engagement (Inactive 14+ days)

**No guilt trip here.** School is busy. Life happens. You might've lost the link. You might've forgotten. That's totally fine.

**We're still here whenever you're ready.** Just reply and I'll send you the login link again.

In the meantime, here's what you missed:
- Module 3 is live (the super interactive one where you train your own AI)
