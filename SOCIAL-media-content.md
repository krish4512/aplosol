## POST #1: LinkedIn - Thought Leadership

**Title:** "Your Kid Uses ChatGPT. But Do They Understand It?"

**Content:**

I realized something this week: My 8-year-old nephew can open ChatGPT, ask it questions, and get answers. But he has no idea how it works.

So I asked him: "Is ChatGPT a person?"
He said: "No, it's smart."
Me: "How is it smart?"
Him: "...I don't know."

And that got me thinking: **We're raising a generation that uses AI every day but understands it zero percent.**

They ask Siri, they watch TikTok's algorithm, they play games with AI opponents. But when you ask them *how* it works, blank stares.

**This is a problem.**

By 2030, AI won't be optional. It'll be embedded in every job, every school, every aspect of life. The students who *understand* AI will have an unfair advantage over those who just use it blindly.

**That's why I built Aplosol.**

A simple, honest curriculum that teaches K-12 students what AI actually is—in 45 minutes, no coding, no jargon.

Not to make them programmers. To make them *literate*.

If you're a parent, educator, or school leader: This is the conversation we need to have with the next generation.

**What's your take?** Do kids need to understand AI?

## POST #2: Twitter/X - Thread

**Opening Tweet:**

Taking my nephew through our new AI literacy course and he just said:

"OH! So AI is like... me learning to ride a bike? It practices and gets better?"

YES. Exactly that.

And honestly, that's way more intuitive than how schools usually explain it (if they explain it at all).

🧵 on why AI education for kids is broken... and how to fix it. 👇

**Tweet 2:**

The problem: Schools haven't updated curriculum for AI yet.
- Most teachers aren't trained on it
- CS programs are coding-focused (different thing)
- Kids are left to figure it out on YouTube or get info from TikTok

Result: Massive knowledge gap.

---

**Tweet 3:**

And it matters because:
- 70% of future jobs will involve AI in some way
- Students who understand AI → better decision-makers
- Early exposure = reduced fear + increased opportunity

But nobody's teaching this. It's like financial literacy in the '90s—everyone agrees it matters, nobody teaches it.

---

**Tweet 4:**

Solution isn't complicated:
✓ Simple curriculum (no jargon)
✓ Short lessons (fit into schedules)
✓ Hands-on (kids build AI, not just watch videos)
✓ Teacher-friendly (minimal prep)

Basically: Do for AI what code.org did for programming.

**Tweet 5:**

And here's the kicker: Kids GET it when you explain it simply.

My 8yo didn't understand "machine learning."
He immediately understood: "Show the computer 100 pictures of cats, it learns the pattern, then it can spot new cats."

Simple > Complex. Always.

---

**Closing Tweet:**

Building a platform to make this happen: Aplosol.

4 modules per grade level. 45 min total. Free to try.

If you're a parent or educator: Give it a shot. AI literacy shouldn't be optional.

## POST #3: TikTok - Short-Form (15-30 sec)

**Concept:** "Common AI Myths BUSTED"

**Script (On-camera, upbeat):**

"Myth #1: AI is magic.
*[Cut to kid with mind-blown expression]*

Truth: AI is just patterns. Here's how:

*[Animated visual: 100 cat pictures]*

Show a computer 100 pictures of cats...

*[Animated visual: AI learning]*

It learns what makes a cat a cat...

*[Animated visual: New cat pic]*

Then it can spot NEW cats it's never seen.

That's it. That's AI.

Not magic. Patterns."

## POST #4: LinkedIn - Case Study (Short)

**Title:** "One School, 87 Students, 4 Weeks: Here's What Happened"

**Content:**

We just wrapped a pilot at [School Name]. 87 students, K-2 through 6-8, completed our AI literacy curriculum.

Here's what surprised us:

**Stat 1:** 94% completion rate
- Most online education is 20-30%
- We hit 94%
- Why? Kids liked it.

**Stat 2:** 8.7/10 satisfaction (student survey)
- Most loved: "I got to train my own AI" (Module 3)
- Least loved: Still 7.9/10
- Memorable quote: "I thought AI was magic. Now I know it's smart patterns."

**Stat 3:** Teacher feedback
- 100% said they'd use it again
- 80% said they'd expand to other grade levels
- Quote: "Takes the scary out of AI for both of us."

**The insight:** Kids aren't afraid of AI. They're *curious* about it. The issue is access to good explanations.

We fixed that.

**Next:** Expanding to 3 more schools in February.

If you're an educator looking for this: DM me. Let's talk.

## POST #5: Twitter/X - Stat Post

**Opening:**

Just learned something wild:

87% of K-12 students use AI tools daily.
12% understand how they work.

That's not a 75% gap.
That's an *education crisis*.

How do we fix it? 🧵👇

## POST #6: LinkedIn - Personal Story

**Title:** "Why I Built Aplosol (And Why It Matters)"

**Content:**

Five years ago, I was teaching basic tech skills to high school students. One day, a kid asked:

"What's the difference between AI and a regular computer?"

I tried to explain. Talked about algorithms, training data, neural networks...

His eyes glazed over.

That night, I thought: "He's going to graduate not understanding one of the most important technologies of his lifetime."

It wasn't his fault. We just don't have good ways to teach this stuff to kids.

**Fast forward to 2026:**

I have a 8-year-old nephew. Same question. So I decided to answer it *properly*.

I spent months building a simple, honest curriculum. No jargon. No coding. Just: "Here's what AI is, here's how it works, here's what it can't do."

45 minutes total.

He got it.

His parents got it.

His teacher asked if she could use it in class.

So I refined it. Tested with 50 kids. Same result: High engagement, clear understanding, kids excited about the future (instead of scared).

**That became Aplosol.**

I'm not trying to train the next generation of AI engineers. There are platforms for that.

I'm trying to give every kid a foundation. So they're not confused when AI shows up in their job, their school, their life.

**That's the mission.**

If you're an educator, school leader, or parent: I'd love your feedback. What would make this better?
