### Script

**[0:00-0:30] INTRO**

> "Hi! I'm Krish, and I'm so excited to teach you about AI today. Have you ever talked to Siri? Or Alexa? Or played a video game where the computer tries to beat you? That's AI! Today, we're going to discover what AI really is, and spoiler alert — it's way cooler than you think."

*[Show quick clips of kids using tech]*

**[0:30-2:00] DEFINITION**

> "AI stands for 'Artificial Intelligence.' Let's break that down.
> 
> 'Artificial' means made by humans — not natural, like a tree or a puppy. We made it.
> 
> 'Intelligence' means the ability to learn, solve problems, and make decisions.
> 
> So AI = computers that can learn and make smart decisions, kind of like you do."

*[Show robot toy 'learning' by picking up blocks]*

> "Imagine you're learning to ride a bike. At first, you fall off a lot. But after practicing, your brain learns. AI works the same way — it practices and gets better."

**[2:00-5:00] EXAMPLES IN DAILY LIFE**

> "Here's the cool part: AI is EVERYWHERE.
> 
> When you watch YouTube, does it suggest videos you actually want to watch? That's AI learning what you like.
> 
> When you text your friend and your phone suggests the next word? AI.
> 
> When you play a video game and the bad guy tries to catch you? Sometimes that's AI making decisions in real-time.
> 
> Even your parents' phones have AI — Siri or Google Assistant."

*[Show real examples: YouTube recommendations, phone autocomplete, game footage]*

**[5:00-8:00] HOW DOES IT LEARN?**

> "So how does a computer actually 'learn'? Let me show you an experiment.
> 
> Imagine I show you 100 pictures of cats and 100 pictures of dogs, and I tell you which is which. After seeing all those pictures, I ask: 'Is THIS a cat or a dog?'
> 
> You'd probably get it right, right? Because your brain recognized patterns — the shape of ears, the tail, the whiskers.
> 
> AI does the EXACT same thing. We feed it thousands of pictures, it learns the patterns, and then it can identify new pictures it's never seen before."

*[Visual: Animated process of AI 'studying' cat/dog pictures]*

**[8:00-10:00] OUTRO + KEY TAKEAWAY**

> "Here's what I want you to remember:
> 
> AI is just computers that learned to recognize patterns and make decisions — like you learned to ride a bike.
> 
> AI isn't magic. It's not alive. It's a tool we built to help us do amazing things.
> 
> And you're growing up in the AI generation. Isn't that awesome?
> 
> In the next lesson, we're going to build our own simple AI game. See you then!"

## MODULE 2: "How Computers Think"
**Duration:** 11 minutes | **Timestamps:** 10:00 - 21:00

### Script

**[10:00-10:30] INTRO + HOOK**

> "Welcome back! Last lesson, we learned that AI learns from patterns. But how does a computer actually THINK? Does it have a brain like you?
> 
> Spoiler: No. But it has something almost as cool. Let me show you."

**[10:30-12:30] BINARY (SIMPLIFIED)**

> "Computers speak a special language: Yes or No. True or False. On or Off.
> 
> Everything your computer does comes down to trillions of tiny switches that are either ON or OFF. That's it.
> 
> We call this Binary.
> 
> *[Show visual of light switch turning on/off]*
> 
> Imagine your teacher asks: 'Is this student ready to go to recess?' 
> 
> Computers ask the same kind of questions:
> - Did the bell ring? Yes or No
> - Are all tasks done? Yes or No
> - Can we go out? Yes or No
> 
> By asking YES/NO questions really, REALLY fast, computers solve huge problems."

**[12:30-15:00] DECISION TREES**

> "Here's something fun: Let's say I'm a robot deciding whether to eat a sandwich.
> 
> *[Draw a simple flowchart on screen]*
> 
> Question 1: Am I hungry? 
> - YES → Question 2
> - NO → Don't eat
> 
> Question 2: Is there a sandwich?
> - YES → Eat it!
> - NO → Go find food
> 
> That's called a Decision Tree. It's how computers make choices.
> 
> AI uses super, super big decision trees with thousands of branches. But the idea is the same: Ask questions, follow the path, make a decision."

*[Animated example of decision tree in action]*

**[15:00-18:00] INPUT → PROCESSING → OUTPUT**

> "Every computer follows the same 3 steps:
> 
> **INPUT:** Information goes IN (like you using your eyes to see)
> **PROCESSING:** The computer thinks about it (like your brain deciding what to do)
> **OUTPUT:** An answer comes OUT (like you talking)
> 
> Example: When you use voice commands with Alexa —
> 
> INPUT: 'Alexa, play my favorite song'
> OUTPUT: She hears you (input)
> PROCESSING: She figures out which song is your favorite
> OUTPUT: The song plays
> 
> Every AI does this: Input → Think → Output."

**[18:00-21:00] OUTRO**

> "So computers don't 'think' like you do. They ask Yes/No questions super fast, follow decision trees, and give you answers.
> 
> It seems magical, but it's really just asking questions and following rules.
> 
> Next lesson: We're going to train our own AI model. Get excited!"

## MODULE 3: "Training AI (Build Your Own)"
**Duration:** 12 minutes | **Timestamps:** 21:00 - 33:00

### Script + Hands-On Activity

**[21:00-21:30] INTRO**

> "Alright, this is the fun one. We're going to train an AI together. You're going to teach a computer to recognize something.
> 
> Ready?"

**[21:30-24:00] THE TRAINING PROCESS**

> "Remember when we talked about learning patterns? Training is exactly that.
> 
> Here's what happens:
> 
> 1. **Show Examples:** We show AI thousands of pictures and label them ('This is a dog, this is a cat')
> 
> 2. **AI Learns Patterns:** The AI looks for patterns (pointy ears = dog, flat face = cat)
> 
> 3. **Test It:** We show it a new picture it's never seen and ask, 'What is this?'
> 
> 4. **Check the Answer:** Was it right? If yes, great. If no, the AI adjusts and tries again.
> 
> *[Animated example of this process]*
> 
> This is called 'Machine Learning.' The machine learns."

**[24:00-28:00] HANDS-ON ACTIVITY: ROCK/PAPER/SCISSORS AI**

> "Let's do this right now. We're going to train an AI to recognize Rock, Paper, Scissors hand gestures.
> 
> Here's what you'll do:
> 
> 1. Make a ROCK gesture at your screen (closed fist)
> 2. Hold it for 3 seconds — AI is watching and learning
> 3. Make a PAPER gesture (flat hand)
> 4. Hold it — AI learns again
> 5. Make a SCISSORS gesture (two fingers)
> 6. Hold it — AI learns this too
> 
> *[Interactive element: Camera activates, tracks user's hands]*
> 
> Okay, now here's the magic moment. Make any gesture, and let's see if the AI recognizes it!"

*[AI attempts to classify the gesture]*

> "Did it work? Awesome! You just trained an AI. In minutes, not weeks.
> 
> This is exactly how AI models learn in the real world. Just with way more data."

**[28:00-33:00] WRAP-UP**

> "Training AI is basically:
> 
> ✓ Show examples
> ✓ Let AI learn patterns
> ✓ Test it
> ✓ Keep improving
> 
> The more good examples you give, the smarter your AI gets.
> 
> And here's the mind-blowing part: Every AI you use — ChatGPT, your camera, recommendations — was trained the exact same way. Same concept, just more data.
> 
> Next lesson: We talk about what AI can't do (and why that matters)."

## MODULE 4: "AI Superpowers & Limits"
**Duration:** 12 minutes | **Timestamps:** 33:00 - 45:00

### Script

**[33:00-34:00] INTRO**

> "You've learned what AI is, how it thinks, and how to train it. Today, the last lesson: What's AI REALLY good at, and what can't it do?"

**[34:00-38:00] AI SUPERPOWERS**

> "AI is amazing at:
> 
> **Pattern Recognition:** Spotting patterns in huge amounts of data instantly. Your brain can do this too, but AI does it MUCH faster.
> 
> **Never Getting Tired:** AI can work 24/7 without stopping. Humans need sleep!
> 
> **Consistency:** AI does the same thing the same way every time. Perfect for repetitive tasks.
> 
> **Speed:** AI makes decisions in milliseconds. 
> 
> Examples:
> - **Doctors:** AI helps detect diseases in X-rays faster than any human
> - **Farms:** AI predicts when crops need water
> - **Driving:** Self-driving cars use AI to make split-second decisions
> 
> *[Show real-world examples with footage]*"

**[38:00-42:00] AI LIMITS (THE IMPORTANT PART)**

> "But here's what AI CAN'T do:
> 
> **AI Can't Understand Context Like You Do**
> 
> Example: If I say 'I'm dying of laughter,' you know it's a joke. AI might think something is actually dying. Humans understand jokes, emotions, sarcasm. AI... struggles.
> 
> **AI Can't Have Real Feelings**
> 
> AI can't love you. It can't feel sad. It's not alive. It's a tool.
> 
> **AI Can't Make Moral Decisions**
> 
> When there's a hard choice (is this fair? Is this right?), humans decide. AI just follows rules.
> 
> **AI Can Only Work With What You Teach It**
> 
> If you train an AI on bad information, it learns bad patterns. 'Garbage in, garbage out.'
> 
> **AI Needs Humans to Be Safe**
> 
> AI is powerful, which means it can cause harm if misused. That's why humans need to watch and control it.
> 
> *[Animated examples of each limit]*"

**[42:00-45:00] OUTRO + FINAL MESSAGE**

> "Here's what you need to remember:
> 
> AI is a tool. Like a hammer. A hammer is great for building, but you need a smart human to use it right.
> 
> AI is going to be everywhere in your future — maybe in your job, in your school, in your home. So understanding it now? That's your superpower.
> 
> You're not afraid of it. You understand it. You know what it can and can't do.
> 
> And that makes you ready for the future.
> 
> **Thank you for learning with me. You just became an AI literacy expert!**
> 
> Have questions? Drop them in the comments, and I'll answer them in the next video.
> 
> See you soon!"
